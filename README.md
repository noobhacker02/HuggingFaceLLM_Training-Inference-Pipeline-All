# HuggingFaceLLM_Training-Inference-Pipeline-All
A complete pipeline for training, inference, and evaluation of a large language model (LLM) using Hugging Face. This repository includes notebooks, scripts, and configuration to take a model from raw data → fine-tuning/training → inference (with examples) plus evaluation and deployment readiness.


## Intended Uses & Limitations

**Intended Uses:**

- Fine-tuning the base model on custom datasets  
- Running inference for tasks such as text generation, summarization, Q&A, etc.  
- Educational / research usage to understand how training pipelines work end-to-end  

**Limitations:**

- Not optimized for extremely large scale models or massive datasets (compute resource constraints)  
- Performance may degrade on very specialized domains unless domain-specific data is used  
- Possible biases inherited from training data; edge cases in language / topics may not be handled well

---

## Training Data

- Datasets used: (specify datasets, e.g. “a mixture of public text corpora, such as Wikipedia, OpenWebText, etc.”)  
- Preprocessing steps: tokenization, cleaning, filtering, etc.  
- Data size / splits: train, validation, test percentages (if applicable)

---

## Training Procedure

- Frameworks and libraries used (Transformers, Datasets, Accelerate etc.)  
- Hyperparameters: epochs, batch size, learning rate, warmup steps, optimizer, etc.  
- Hardware used (GPUs / TPUs, approximate compute)  
- Any data augmentation or special techniques used (e.g. mixed precision, gradient accumulation, etc.)

---

## Evaluation & Metrics

- Metric(s) used: e.g. perplexity, BLEU, ROUGE, accuracy etc.  
- Evaluation datasets (which set, split)  


## Bias, Risks & Ethical Considerations

- Possible biases: due to data sampling, content domains, language variety etc.  
- Risks: misuse for misinformation, biased or harmful language, inappropriate content generation  
- Mitigations: dataset filtering, bias evaluation, user warnings, human-in-loop for sensitive tasks

## How to Use

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, pipeline

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("your-username/myHuggingFaceLLM_Training-Inference-Pipeline-All")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("your-username/myHuggingFaceLLM_Training-Inference-Pipeline-All")

gen = pipeline("text-generation", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)
output = gen("Your prompt here", max_length=50)
print(output)
